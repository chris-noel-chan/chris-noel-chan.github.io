		<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
		<p>Everything I do, I do in the name of making a better world. I want my impact on society to be a huge net positive, and I intend to do so through advertising.</p>
		<p>A lot of people have a negative view of advertisements—they're invasive, they're meant to brainwash, and there's something slightly inhuman in their intent to make you buy stuff by any means necessary. It's been that way since the rise of the industrial revolution, and I believe we can do better—we can use it to inspire and cultivate a better world.</p>
		<p>I work with cool technology to bring great ideas into reality, and I inspire with artistry and sensual design.</p>

			<h1>Engineers Without Borders</h1>
			<p>Greetings, and welcome to our introduction site! You've probably got a lot of questions—and if you do, you're totally our kind of person—read on, friend!</p>
			<a href="#whoyou" class="nxt-btn"></a>
		</article>

		<section class="questions">

			<article id="whoyou" class="o-box">
				<span>Question:</span>
				<h2>Who are you?</h2>
				<span>Answer:</span>
				<p>Engineers Without Borders (or <em>EWB</em> for short) is a charitable non-profit organization focused on the long-term development of third-world countries. We are a team of student and professional volunteers, overseas field operatives, and staff at our national office.</p>
				<p>Contrary to what you might think, many of us are not in the field of engineering! We call ourselves engineers because our problem solving approach parallels that of trained engineers: <em>systematic,</em> <em>innovative,</em> and <em>measurable</em>. Why such an approach? Because we at EWB believe that in order to make a difference, it takes more than good intentions alone.</p>

			<article id="workfor" class="o-box">
				<span>Question:</span>
				<h2>Who do you work for?</h2>
				<span>Answer:</span>
				<p>We work for those who live in extreme poverty because of systemic neglect or injustice; those who have the fervent desires to make a better life for their communities, but face a lack of opportunity.</p>
				<p>Though this scenario is present everywhere to some degree, EWB currently focuses efforts in a few select African countries where we've found the greatest need and the best investment of our efforts.</p>
				<a href="#whatneed" class="nxt-btn"></a>
			</article>

			<article id="whatneed" class="o-box">
				<span>Question:</span>
				<h2>What do they need?</h2>
				<span>Answer:</span>
				<p>Above all, we believe what the people we help need the most is the opportunity to help themselves. Our focus is not to provide foreign aid or relief, but to promote foreign development. Though we deeply respect and uphold the same values of those who aim to provide relief, we believe that systematic changes that work to build the capacity of a people is a more sustainable way out of extreme poverty.</p>

			</article>

			<article id="howhelp" class="o-box">
				<span>Question:</span>
				<h2>How do you help them?</h2>
				<span>Answer:</span>
				<p>We have a multitude of initiatives both overseas and at home. In Canada, we advocate for foreign policies and fair business practices that affect hard-working African entrepreneurs.</p>
				<p>In Africa, our field operatives work with local government and community leaders on different projects to remove the various barriers between an African's hard work and a positive outcome.</p>
				<p>We aim to create changes that last after we leave. We aim to work ourselves out of our job.</p>
