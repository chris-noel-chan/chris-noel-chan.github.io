		<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
		<p>Everything I do, I do in the name of making a better world. I want my impact on society to be a huge net positive, and I intend to do so through advertising.</p>
		<p>A lot of people have a negative view of advertisements—they're invasive, they're meant to brainwash, and there's something slightly inhuman in their intent to make you buy stuff by any means necessary. It's been that way since the rise of the industrial revolution, and I believe we can do better—we can use it to inspire and cultivate a better world.</p>
		<p>I work with cool technology to bring great ideas into reality, and I inspire with artistry and sensual design.</p>
		<p>Interested in working together? Come say hello</p>
